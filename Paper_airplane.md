Hello, I am giving directions for making paper planes
First, fold the paper into two equal halves
Bend the tips of the paper equally in tandem with their corner angles
Fold the quater halves of the paper into smaller bits
Turn in the paper in a symmetrical way so that the base is bent and the flaps are extended
Thereafter adjust the tips to ensure the frontal part is properly fit.
