 gunzip N2.R1.fastq.gz to unzip file
fastqc N2.R1.fastq and fastqc N2.R2.fastq
Both the forward (N2.R1) and reverse (N2.R2) reads need trimming since the fastqc quality assessment reveals some poor per base sequence qualities and per base sequence contents
cutadapt -q 27,27 -a TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG -A GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG -m 50 --max-n 0 -o N2.R1.cutadapt.fastq -p N2.R2.cutadapt.fastq N2.R1.fastq N2.R2.fastq
(phred score of 27 for each read, TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG as forward adaptor, GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG as reverse adaptor, minimum lenght is 50 while maximum lenght is 0)
Total volume of quality trimmed in both reads (N2.R1 and N2.R2) was 16.6% while proportion of the both genome reads (N2.R1 and N2.R2) filtered was 83.4% 
wget https://sra-download.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/traces/wgs03/wgs_aux/FW/YH/FWYH01/FWYH01.1.fsa_nt.gz (to get the reference sequence of N2)
N2 is Planomicrobium okeanokoites
gunzip FWYH01.1.fsa_nt.gz to unzip the reference sequence. Then head FWYH01.1.fsa_nt (to view the reference sequence).
