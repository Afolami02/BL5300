 gunzip N2.R1.fastq.gz to unzip file
fastqc N2.R1.fastq and fastqc N2.R2.fastq
Both the forward (N2.R1) and reverse (N2.R2) reads need trimming since the fastqc quality assessment reveals some poor per base sequence qualities and per base sequence contents
cutadapt -q 27,27 -a TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG -A GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG -m 50 --max-n 0 -o N2.R1.cutadapt.fastq -p N2.R2.cutadapt.fastq N2.R1.fastq N2.R2.fastq
(phred score of 27 for each read, TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG as forward adaptor, GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG as reverse adaptor, minimum lenght is 50 while maximum lenght is 0)
Total volume of quality trimmed in both reads (N2.R1 and N2.R2) was 16.6% while proportion of the both genome reads (N2.R1 and N2.R2) filtered was 83.4% 
The total portion of the forward read (N2.R1) with the adaptor is 1.7% while only 1.6% of the reverse read (N2.R2) contains the adpator sequence
wget https://sra-download.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/traces/wgs03/wgs_aux/FW/YH/FWYH01/FWYH01.1.fsa_nt.gz (to get the reference sequence of N2)
N2 is Planomicrobium okeanokoites
gunzip FWYH01.1.fsa_nt.gz to unzip the reference sequence. Then head FWYH01.1.fsa_nt (to view the reference sequence). 
bowtie2-build FWYH01.1.fsa_nt Ref.N2 (to index the reference sequence in FWYH01.1.fsa_nt)
bowtie2 -x Ref.N2 -1 N2.R1.fastq -2 N2.R2.fastq -S N2.sam  (to map the index reference into the raw sequencing data reads)
less or head N2.sam (view alignments in the N2 reference sequence and what N2 read alignments were mapped into reference)
grep -c "@SQ" N2.sam (count the reference sequence in indexed N2 reference) and grep -c "M0" N2.sam (count the number of mapped reads in N2 forward and reverse (R1 and R2) to the reference sequence)
The number of reference sequence indexed is 10 while the number of mapped reads in N2.sam is 2644333
samtools view -b N2.sam | samtools sort - > N2.bam (To convert N2.sam to .bam file using samtools)
samtools index N2.bam (Index the N2.bam file)

bcftools filter --exclud 'QUAL < 30' raw.calls_N2.bcf > N2_calls.vcf (to filter the variant calls)
grep -c "F" N2_calls.vcf (to count the number of variant calls in the mapped read). The total variant calls were 33,978
less N2_calls.vcf and head N2_calls.vcf
bcftools view -v snps N2_calls.vcf > N2_snp.vcf (to selectively extract single nucleotide polymorphisms)
head N2_snp.vcf and less N2_snp.vcf
bgzip N2_calls.vcf | bcftools index N2_calls.vcf.gz (to zip and index the N2 variant calls)
cat FWYH01.1.fsa_nt | bcftools consensus N2_calls.vcf.gz > N2_DSMZ.fasta (to create a consensus fasta sequence file with the reference N2, the alignments and the SNPs) 
head N2_DSMZ.fasta and less N2_DSMZ.fasta (to view consensus fasta assembly generated)
grep -c "contig" N2_DSMZ.fasta (to count the number of contings in the new consensus reference sequence)
There are 10 contigs in this new consensus fasta.

Use winscp to assess the report files (pdf and .html) and assess quality of the assembly
conda activate annotation

prokka --outdir N2 --prefix N2 N2_contigs_names.fasta (annotation of gene reads)
(From the N2.txt file, there are 9663 contigs, 33 rRNA, 5 repeat regions, 203 tRNA, 4 tmRNA)
grep "COG" N2.tsv| cut -f6| sort| uniq -c| sort -n| sort>N2_cogs.txt (to separate, count and know the number of COG defined genes as well as most frequent COG)
grep -c "=COG" N2.gff, grep -c "eC" N2.gff (there are 3378 genes with enzyme commission numbers while 4197 genes have clusters of orthologous gene assessions)
(COG1960 was the most frequent occurring 19 times in the annotation output)
cut -f5 N2.tsv| sort| uniq -c| sort -n| sort>N2_ec.txt (to separate out a file with EC numbers and as well the most frequently occurring EC number)
The N2.faa file is greater than 10,000 Amino acid sequence queries so I splitted the whole file into 2
head -n 18001 N2.faa>N2_a.faa then Tail -n +18002 N2.faa> N2_b.faa.
